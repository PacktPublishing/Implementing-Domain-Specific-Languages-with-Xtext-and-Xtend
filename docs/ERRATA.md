ERRATA for the book "Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend, 2nd Edition"
============================

Chapter 13
====
Page 344: the box refers to the initial version of the project for the EMF School model that can be found here: https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/emf-school-model. Such a git repository was empty until today (15 April 2017); sorry, I had forgotten to push such a project.

Furthermore, as stressed in the introduction of this chapter, this section assumes that you're familiar with EMF model definition, thus, what follows (i.e., creating a new Xtext project starting from an existing Ecore model) assumes that you know how to run EMF genmodel generator in order to generate the Java classes for the model.

Page 349: in the second code snippet, the line "class SchoolValixtends extends ..." should be "class SchoolValidator extends  ...".

Page 379: in the code snippet, the method name "internalToxpression" should be "internalToConvertedExpression" (as said in the text of the paragraph).
